Once that Hero and their Warband has been deployed, Gríma's controlling player can deploy Gríma as if he was also part of that Warband, following all the usual deployment rules. Gríma is still part of his controlling player's Army, and will Activate like any other model in his controlling player's Army.\nIf Gríma is deployed as part of the enemy Army, then enemy models treat him as a friendly model, and therefore cannot shoot him, Charge him, make Strikes against him, target him with special rules, or make a shooting attack in which Gríma would be In The Way. They may also ignore his Control Zone. They can, however, target him with Magical Powers like\nany other enemy model.\nWhilst Gríma is considered a friendly model, Grima may ignore the Control Zones of enemy models and may Move through enemy models as if they weren't there. When Gríma Moves this way, he cannot end his Move overlapping or in base contact with an enemy model. Grima can choose to Charge an enemy model as normal if he wishes.\nThese restrictions immediately end if Saruman is slain, if Grima Charges an enemy model, if Grima destroys an enemy Siege Engine, or if Grima interacts with an Objective Marker (such as destroying a Supply Marker or picking up an objective), at which point Grima is treated as a normal enemy model and can be Charged, shot at and slain like any other model"

A model that Moves in this way cannot end its Move overlapping another model, within a piece of woodland terrain, or upon any surface in which it cannot balance safely (flat rock and hills are fine, but don't try perching a model upon a sloped roof for example). Additionally, a model that Moves in this way cannot finish its Move atop a piece of terrain which it is impossible for the enemy to reach, such as at the top of a sheer rock face with no way up, or straddling one or more pieces of terrain that would allow other models to Move underneath.\n                If a model wishes to do something part way through its Move whilst it is Flying (such as Cast a Magical Power), then it must land in order to do so. When a model lands, there cannot be any models underneath it, and if it lands in an enemy model's Control Zone then it must Charge that enemy model.\n                A model with this special rule can choose not to Fly, and in which case will treat its Move Value as 4\" rather than that listed in its profile (usually 12\"). lf it does, then it gains none of the benefits of the Fly special rule, though it may enter a piece of woodland terrain; however, if it enters a piece of woodland terrain, it cannot elect to Fly again until it has completely left the woods.\n                A model that chooses to Fly will ignore enemy Control Zones as it Moves. A model that wishes to Charge when it is flying can Charge any model whose Control Zone it finishes its Move in. If a Flying model wishes to Charge a model that is already Engaged in Combat (or has otherwise lost their Control Zone) then it can only do so if it can land in a position where is is not within the Control Zones of other enemy models."

Instead, at the end of the Move Phase on the third turn (after both sides have moved all their models), the ambushing Warband must choose one of the following:\n            • Move onto the board from any board edge via the rules for Reinforcements.\n            • Deploy in, or within 1\" of, a wood, building, rocky outcrop or other similar piece of terrain that the models could hide in. A degree of common sense is required when deciding which pieces of terrain the Warband can hide in – they shouldn’t be leaping out of a river or from behind a single rock! You should always agree with your opponent at the beginning of the game which terrain pieces are eligible to ambush from. Models deployed in this way cannot be placed in base contact with, or within the Control Zones of, enemy models. Models that enter the board this way do not Activate as part of the Move Phase, and will count as having Moved half their Move Value for the purposes of shooting."
